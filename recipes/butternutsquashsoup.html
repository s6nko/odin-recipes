    <p>This is a thick, rich soup with tons of flavor. Something I whipped up off the top of my head, with things I had on hand. Super easy, quick and a great way to use squash. An instant hit.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>1 small onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 stalk celery, chopped</li>
        <li>1 medium carrot, chopped</li>
        <li>2 medium potatoes, cubed</li>
        <li>1 medium butternut squash - peeled, seeded, and cubed</li>
        <li>1 (32 fluid once) container chicken stock</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h4>Step 1</h4>
    Melt the butter in a large pot, and cook the onions, celery, carrot, potatoes, and squash 5 minutes, or until lightly browned. Pour in enough of the chicken stock to cover vegetables. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover pot, and simmer 40 mintutes or until all vegetables are tender.
    <h4>Step 2</h4>
    Transfer the soup to a blender, and blend until smooth. Return to pot, and mix in any remaining stock to attain desired consistency. Season with salt and pepper.
